## 🧪 Testing & Validation (60 min)

### Python Fetcher Testing

**Step 1: Basic Syntax Check**
- [ ] No Python syntax errors
  ```bash
  python3 -m py_compile fetch_news_seasia.py
  ```

**Step 2: Test Feed Parsing**
- [ ] Test with 1-2 sample feeds
  ```bash
  python3 -c "
  import feedparser
  url = 'https://www.seafdec.org/feed/'
  result = feedparser.parse(url)
  print(f'Feed entries: {len(result.entries)}')
  for entry in result.entries[:2]:
      print(f'  - {entry.title[:50]}...')
  "
  ```

**Step 3: Create Data Directories**
- [ ] Create directory structure
  ```bash
  mkdir -p data/seasia_coastal/articles_raw
  mkdir -p data/seasia_coastal/by_country/{VN,TH,PH,ID,MY,MM,KH,SG,BN}
  mkdir -p data/seasia_coastal/by_topic
  ```

**Step 4: Test Feed Fetcher with Small Set**
- [ ] Run mini version with 2-3 feeds
- [ ] Check for errors:
  - [ ] No network timeouts
  - [ ] No parsing errors
  - [ ] Relevant articles found

**Step 5: Full Fetcher Run**
- [ ] Run complete fetcher
  ```bash
  python3 fetch_news_seasia.py
  ```
- [ ] Verify outputs:
  - [ ] `README_SEASIA_COASTAL.md` created ✅
  - [ ] `data/seasia_coastal/articles_raw/articles_*.json` created ✅
  - [ ] `data/seasia_coastal/by_country/*/README.md` created ✅
  - [ ] No error messages

**Step 6: Validate Fetcher Output**
- [ ] Check article count: expect 30-50 articles
  ```bash
  python3 -c "
  import json
  with open('data/seasia_coastal/articles_raw/articles_*.json') as f:
    articles = json.load(f)
    print(f'Total articles: {len(articles)}')
    print(f'Countries: {set(a for art in articles for a in art[\"countries\"])}')
    print(f'Topics: {set(t for art in articles for t in art[\"topics\"])}')
  "
  ```
- [ ] Check for duplicates: should be minimal
- [ ] Check for topic assignment: most articles should have 1+ topics
- [ ] Check for country assignment: all should have country codes

**Step 7: Review Generated Digests**
- [ ] Open `README_SEASIA_COASTAL.md` in editor
  - [ ] All sections populated
  - [ ] Links are valid
  - [ ] Timestamps correct
- [ ] Random-check country digests
  ```bash
  cat data/seasia_coastal/by_country/VN/README.md
  cat data/seasia_coastal/by_country/TH/README.md
  ```
  - [ ] Proper country focus
  - [ ] Relevance to coastal issues

---

### JavaScript Brief Generator Testing

**Step 1: Basic Syntax Check**
- [ ] No JavaScript syntax errors
  ```bash
  node --check generateBrief_seasia.js
  ```

**Step 2: Install Dependencies**
- [ ] Install openai SDK
  ```bash
  npm install openai
  ```
- [ ] Verify installation
  ```bash
  ls node_modules/openai
  ```

**Step 3: Environment Setup**
- [ ] OpenAI API key is set
  ```bash
  echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
  ```
- [ ] API key has quota
  ```bash
  # Show first/last 4 chars only
  echo "Key format: ${OPENAI_API_KEY:0:4}...${OPENAI_API_KEY: -4}"
  ```

**Step 4: Test Brief Generator**
- [ ] Run brief generator
  ```bash
  node generateBrief_seasia.js
  ```
- [ ] Expected output:
  - [ ] Loads articles successfully
  - [ ] Generates regional brief
  - [ ] Generates 9 country briefs
  - [ ] Generates 5 topic briefs (optional if limited on API)

**Step 5: Validate Brief Output**
- [ ] Check main brief file created
  ```bash
  cat data/seasia_coastal/BRIEF.json | head -20
  ```
  - [ ] Valid JSON
  - [ ] Contains brief text (not empty)
  - [ ] Generated timestamp exists

- [ ] Check country briefs created
  ```bash
  wc -l data/seasia_coastal/by_country/*/BRIEF.json
  ```
  - [ ] All 9 countries have brief files
  - [ ] Each brief has meaningful content

- [ ] Read sample brief
  ```bash
  jq '.brief' data/seasia_coastal/BRIEF.json
  jq '.brief' data/seasia_coastal/by_country/VN/BRIEF.json
  ```
  - [ ] Briefs are coherent
  - [ ] Language is appropriate for audience
  - [ ] Geographic/topic relevance evident

## 📊 Integration Testing (45 min)

### End-to-End Pipeline
- [ ] Run complete pipeline in sequence
  ```bash
  # 1. Fetch news
  python3 fetch_news_seasia.py
  
  # 2. Generate briefs
  node generateBrief_seasia.js
  ```
- [ ] Both scripts complete without errors
- [ ] All output files present
- [ ] No data loss between steps

### Data Consistency
- [ ] Articles in briefs match fetched articles
- [ ] Country assignments match between scripts
- [ ] Topic assignments consistent
- [ ] No articles missing or corrupted

### Performance
- [ ] Fetcher completes in < 5 minutes (with network)
- [ ] Brief generator completes in < 10 minutes (with OpenAI)
- [ ] No memory leaks or hung processes

### Accessibility
- [ ] Markdown files human-readable
- [ ] JSON files valid and parseable
  ```bash
  python3 -c "
  import json
  import glob
  for f in glob.glob('data/seasia_coastal/**/*.json', recursive=True):
    with open(f) as fp:
      json.load(fp)
    print(f'✓ {f}')
  "
  ```

    entries = len(result.entries)
    status = '✓' if entries > 0 else '✗'
    print(f'{status} {feed_url}: {entries} entries')
  "
  ```

### Monthly Tasks
- [ ] First of month: Archive old data
  ```bash
  # Move articles older than 30 days to archive
  ```

- [ ] Mid-month: Collect feedback
  - Email grassroot leaders users
  - Ask: "Was this helpful? Any missing topics?"

- [ ] End of month: Add/remove feeds based on quality

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Fixes

**Issue: "No articles found"**
- [ ] Check if feeds are accessible
- [ ] Check if keyword filtering is too strict
- [ ] Increase MAX_ITEMS_PER_FEED temporarily
- [ ] Verify country keywords match article content
- [ ] Verify required headline terms are present in article titles
- [ ] Verify disallowed term "Venezuela" is not blocking valid SEA headlines unexpectedly

**Issue: "OpenAI API Error"**
- [ ] Verify OPENAI_API_KEY is set
- [ ] Check API quotas in OpenAI dashboard
- [ ] Test with curl: `curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models`
- [ ] Fall back to simple synthesis (no OpenAI)

**Issue: "Articles not deduplicating"**
- [ ] Check similarity threshold (currently 85%)
- [ ] Lower to 75% if too many duplicates
- [ ] Review deduplication logic in fetch script

**Issue: "Wrong countries assigned to articles"**
- [ ] Review country keyword list
- [ ] Add more specific terms
- [ ] Manual review of incorrect assignments
- [ ] Update keyword filtering

**Issue: "Scripts hanging/timing out"**
- [ ] Check network connectivity
- [ ] Increase timeout values
- [ ] Run with fewer feeds initially
- [ ] Check system resources (disk space, RAM)
